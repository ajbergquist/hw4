    "The main challenge in keeping episodes from terminating is keeping angle of the pole as close to zero as possible. To achieve this, we want to push the cart in the same direction that the pole is leaning, to force the bottom of the pole back under the top of the pole towards verticality. The exception to this rule is when the pole is already moving towards the vertical position, in which case we should just push on the cart against its direction of movement. This keeps from accelerating the cart excessively, which would make future corrections of the pole angle more difficult."
